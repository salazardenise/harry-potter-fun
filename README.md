# Data Structures Hackbright Exercise

This exercise explores Python lists, sets, and tuples data structures. Data of students, instructors, and ghosts from the world of Harry Potter are included in the cohort_data.txt file. Each line in that file is formatted in the following manner:
```
first_name | last_name | house | advisor | cohort
```

Several functions are implemented that interact with this data in cohort_data.py. Function signatures and doctests were provided by Hackbright.
